  <ThingDef ParentName="RockBase">
    <defName>MineableHP_Auramite</defName>
    <label>Auramite ore</label>
    <description>Rock containing bits of Auramite.\n\nA powerful material of unknown origin, used only in the armor and equipment of the Adeptus Custodes, the bodyguards of the God-Emperor of Mankind. As well as being exceptionally strong, it is also inert at the quantum level, providing minimal disruption for the psykers of old. Its natural tint is a golden color - while there used to be top-secret chemical processes to change its color at the molecular level, those processes were lost to time.\n\nThe One True Armor, the Power Armor used by the Master of Mankind Himself, was wrought of auramite, allowing him to freely channel his massive psychic power to destroy His enemies. However, He met his match in the form of His corrupted son, the arch-heretic Warmaster Horus Lupercal. The wounds He suffered from slaying His son bound the Emperor to the Golden Throne up until the very moment of His death.</description>
